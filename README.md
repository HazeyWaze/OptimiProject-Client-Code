This is the readme for the client project for the server project go to https://github.com/HazeyWaze/OptimiServerCode

Prerequisites: 

Node.js Verson 18.16.0 Which can be found herehttps://nodejs.org/en/download

Angular which can be installed with 'npm install -g @angular/cli'
Boostrap 'npm install bootstrap'
jquery
poppers

Run 'npm intall' or 'npm install --force'

To run the server run the comand "`ng serve`" or ' ng server --open'

To stop the server just prest Ctrl +c

This server runs on port 4200

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

Due to changing angular versions in the middle of developement I have notice an issue running this project
If there are issues running the server try deleting node_modules and packacke-lock.json and run npm install or just run npm install --force
Sorry about this inconveience
